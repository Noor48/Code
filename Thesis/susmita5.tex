    \section{Abstract}
    The thermophysical properties of segregating and demixing liquid binary
    alloys is presented containing the simple methods that are typically operated by
    physicists, chemists, and metallurgists in general. The different experimental and theoretical data 
    available for such systems are placed together to show a decent knowledge between the experimental 
    results, theoretical processes, and empirical models. The key to learning is the variation that the 
    properties indicate from Raoult's
    law and the significant modification in the liquid phase as a function of composition, temperature, 
    and pressure. The typical behavior is explained to an outcome of the interplay of
    the energetic and structural re-adjustment of the constituent elements on mixing. After summarizing 
    the experimental technique and some results, a complete microscopic
    procedure, based on statistical and hard sphere-like theory, is embarked to elevate the knowledge 
    of the origin of the intriguing processes that are associated with the segregating or phase-separating 
    liquid binary alloys. We terminate by supplying a brief account
    of the kinetic characteristics of segregation (phase separation) with some deliberate industrial 
    applications.

        \section{Introduction}
        Theoreticians have briefed the significance of the mixing properties of binary liquid alloys 
        from both the scientific and the technological points of view. A precise understanding of 
        the mixing properties and phase diagrams of the alloy system is elementary to establish a 
        good arrangement between the experimental results, theoretical approaches, and empirical 
        models for liquid alloys with a miscibility gap.
        All liquid binary alloys can be grouped into two distinct classes that either exhibit 
        positive deviation(usually called segregating systems) or negative deviation (i.e. 
        short-ranged ordered alloys) from Raoult's law or the additive rule of mixing. If the 
        deviations are considerably large, they may conduct either phase separation or compound 
        formation in the binary system. \\

            There are liquid alloys, however, which do not belong exclusively to any of the above 
        two classes. For instance, the excess Gibbs energy of mixing $(G ^{xs} _{M} )$ for Cd–Na, and 
        Ag–Ge is negative at certain compositions, while positive at other compositions. In 
        liquid alloys such as Au–Bi, Bi–Cd, and Bi–Sb, the enthalpy of mixing $H_{M}$ is a 
        positive quantity but $G^{xs} _{M}$  is negative. Bi–Pb has positive $H_{M}$ and $G^{xs}_{M} $ in the 
        solid phase as against the negative values of $H_{M}$ and $G^{xs} _{M}$ in the liquid phase\cite{s1}. 
        Systems such as Au–Ni and Cr–Mo exhibit immiscibility in the solid phase which is not 
        visible in the interrelated liquid phase. Systems such as Ag–Te show intermetallic 
        phases and large negative $H_{M}$ values in the liquid phase concurrently with a liquid 
        miscibility gap. \\

        
            Systems such as Al–Bi, Al–In, Al–Pb, Bi–Ga, Bi–Zn, Cd–Ga, Ga–Pb, Ga–Hg, Pb–Zn, Pb–Si 
        and Cu–Pb, etc, are represented by liquid miscibility gaps and exhibit enormous positive 
        $H_{M}$. Their properties in the liquid phase tend to vary markedly as a role of composition (c),
        temperature (T ), and pressure (p). The long-wavelength limit (q→0)of the 
        composition–composition structure factors, $S_{cc}$ (0) diverges as the composition and 
        temperature approach the critical values c → $c_{c}$, and T → $T_{c}$. $S_{cc}$ (0), which can instantly
        be obtained from thermodynamic functions (either acquired by taking the first composition 
        derivative of the activity or through the second derivative of the Gibbs function), is 
        very useful for establishing the immiscibility and the degree of segregation in binary 
        liquid alloys. Additional thermodynamic, structural, and transport properties are also 
        found to alter anomalously in the area of $c_{c}$ and $T_{c}$. \\ 


            A provided unary system is expressed by two pairs of independent variables, namely 
        the mechanical degrees of freedom (pressure (p) or volume ($\Omega$)) and the thermal 
        degrees of freedom (temperature (T) or entropy (S)). The preference of independent 
        variables is mostly a concern of free option; yet, there are four possibilities for 
        creating such pairs have one mechanical and one thermal variable, say (S,$\Omega$ ), 
        (S, p), (T, $\Omega$) and (T, p). These pairs guide to thermodynamic functions such as 
        internal energy E(S,$\Omega$), enthalpy H (S, p), Helmholtz energy F (T, $\Omega$), and 
        Gibbs energy G(T, p), respectively.\\

        The enthalpy, H, merging the internal energy E to the mechanical degrees of freedom
        (p, $\Omega$) is\\
                        
                    \begin{equation}
                        H = E + p\Omega
                    \end{equation}

        or in differential form,
                    
                    \begin{equation}
                        dH = \delta Q + \Omega dp
                    \end{equation}

        where       \begin{equation*}
                        \delta Q = dE + pd \Omega
                    \end{equation*}

        The Helmholtz energy, F, relates E to the thermal degrees of freedom (S,T), i.e.\\

                    \begin{equation}
                        F = E - TS
                    \end{equation}

        or,

                    \begin{equation}
                        dF = -SdT - pd \Omega
                    \end{equation}

        In the case of reversible isothermal and isochoric processes (T , $\Omega$ = constant),
        dF = 0, i.e.
        F remains invariant.
            Similarly, the Gibbs function establishes a relation between H and the thermal degrees
        of freedom, i.e.\\

                    \begin{equation}
                    G = H - TS
                    \end{equation}

    or

                    \begin{equation}
                    dG = -S dT + \Omega dp
                    \end{equation}

        In the case of a reversible isothermal reaction at constant pressure (T , p = constant),
        dG = 0, i.e. G remains invariant.\\

            Also, H , F and G can readily be used to obtain the heat capacity C ($C_{p}$ or $C_{\Omega}$ ),
        entropy, isothermal ($\chi _{T}$ ) and adiabatic ($\chi _{S}$) compressibilities, the volume and the volume
        expansivity ($\alpha  _{p}$):\\

        \begin{align}
        &  C_{p} = \left(\frac{\partial H }{ \partial T}\right)_{p} = T \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right) _{p} = -T \left(\frac{\partial ^2 G }{ \partial T^2}\right) _p \\
        & C_{\Omega} = \left(\frac{\partial E }{ \partial T}\right)_{\Omega} = T \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right) _{\Omega} = -T \left(\frac{\partial ^2 F }{ \partial T^2}\right) _\Omega \\
        & S = \left(\frac{\partial G }{ \partial T}\right)_{p} =  \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial T} \right) _{\Omega} \\
        & \Omega  = \left(\frac{\partial G }{ \partial p}\right)_{T} \\
        & \chi _T  \equiv  - \frac{1}{ \Omega} \left(\frac{\partial  \Omega }{ \partial p}\right)_{T} \\ 
        & \chi _S  \equiv  - \frac{1}{ \Omega} \left(\frac{\partial  \Omega }{ \partial p}\right)_{S} \\
        & \alpha  _p  \equiv  \frac{1}{ \Omega} \left(\frac{\partial  \Omega }{ \partial T}\right)_{p}  
        \end{align}\\

        At indicator, we furthermore have some important effects from isotherms of liquid–vapor phases which at the critical point must fulfill
        \begin{align}
        & \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \Omega} \right) _{T_{c}} = \left(\frac{\partial ^2 p}{\partial \Omega ^2} \right) _{T_{c}} =0
        \end{align}\\

        At T = $T_c$ , the following physical properties become infinite, i.e.\\


        \begin{align}
        & C_p = T \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right) _p = \infty \\
        & \alpha _p = \frac{1}{\Omega} \left(\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial T} \right) _p = \infty \\
        & \chi _T = -\left(\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial p} \right) _T = \infty 
        \end{align}\\

        For a binary mixture, such as an A–B alloy consisting of $c_A$ moles of component A and $c_B$
        moles of component B, rather than guiding to the fundamental values of their function, 
        we define the function of mixing. For example, the Gibbs energy of mixing, $G_M$ , is represented as

        \begin{equation}
            G_M = G(alloy) - c_A G^{0}_{A} - c_B G^{0}_{B}
        \end{equation}

    where $G ^{0}_{A}$ and $G ^{0}_{B}$ are the Gibbs free energy of the two pure components. Equivalent
    definitions also exist for HM , SM and other functions.The integral quantities can also be divided 
    into the partial quantities, i.e.

        \begin{equation}
            G_M = c_A \overline{G} _{M,A} + c_B \overline{G} _{M,B}
        \end{equation}
    with
        \begin{equation}
            \overline{G} _{M,i} = RT ln a_i                \tag*{( i= A,B )}
        \end{equation}
    where  $\overline{G} _{M,i} $ are the partial Gibbs energies and $a _{i}$ are the thermodynamic 
    activities of the component i.
    $G _M$ defines the stability of the phases in a binary mixture. The curves describing
    $G _M$ against c deviation can, in general, have a shape like either curve a or curve b as displayed
    in figure 1.\cite{s3} For $G _M$ as in curve a, the homogeneous solution is stable at all values of c at
    $T _1$ ; if not other phases (i.e. intermediate phases) in the system display more negative $G _M$
    values.


        
    \begin{adjustbox}{center,caption={A schematic diagram symbolizing the Gibbs energy of mixing at constant T plotted against concentration. 
        Curve a, complete mixing ($ T _1 < T _c $). 
        Curve b, incomplete mixing ($ T _2 < T _c $), 
        $\Delta c$ represents the miscibility gap at $ T _2$ .},label={somelabel},nofloat=figure,vspace=\bigskipamount}
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fi 1}
    \end{adjustbox}
        

        For curve b, the homogeneous solution is varying in the composition range $\Delta c$, because
    $G _M$ can be reduced if the mixture separates into two phases. The composition of these phases
    is provided by the points of contact P and Q of the common tangent line to the $G _M$(c) curve.
    The reduced $G _M$  values of these two phases are given by this line. Within the composition
    range $\Delta c$ only the portions of the two phases change if the total composition of the alloy
    modifications. At P($c _1$) and Q($c _2$) the partial Gibbs energies of the components of both diverged
    phases are equivalent,

        \begin{equation}
            \overline{G} _{M,i}(c _{1}) =  \overline{G} _{M,i}(c _{2})          \tag*{( i= A,B )}
        \end{equation}

        Hence P and Q indicate the limit of thermodynamic equilibrium. $G _M$ diverts as a function of
    temperature from a concave to a convex surface for $\Delta c $ at the spinodal. The points of
    inflection in the curves define the spinodal line. The critical composition and the critical
    temperature are determined from the conditions at T = $T _c$\\

        \begin{align}
            \left(\frac{d^2 {G _M}}{d c^2} \right) _{c = c_c} = 0 \\
            \left(\frac{d^3 {G _M}}{d c^3} \right) _{c = c_c} = 0 
        \end{align}


        At this step, it should be pointed out that the long-wavelength limit (q → 0) of
    the structure factor $S _{cc} $(q) which is well known as the
    concentration fluctuation, $S _{cc} $(0), is also correlated to the thermodynamic function, i.e

        \begin{equation}
            S_{cc}(0) =  RT \left(\frac{d^2 G _M}{d c^2} \right) ^ {-1}_ {T,P}
        \end{equation}
    As $ c\to c _c$ and $ T\to T_c $ ,one sees that

        \begin{equation}
            S_{cc}(0) \to \infty
        \end{equation}  
    Thus, a phase separation in a binary mixture is signaled by a strong enhancement of the
    concentration fluctuations. 
    The ideal solution behavior (HM = 0) of a binary mixture is presented by
        \begin{equation}
            G ^ {id} _M = RT (c_A \ ln c_A + c_B \ ln c_B).
        \end{equation}

    The distinctions in the thermodynamic behavior of a real binary solution and an ideal solution 
    are represented by the excess quantities, i.e.
        \begin{equation}
            G ^ {xs} _M = G _M - G ^{id} _M
        \end{equation}

    or using equation (5)

        \begin{equation}
            G ^ {xs} _M = H _M - T S ^{xs} _M
        \end{equation}
    with
        \begin{equation}
            S ^{xs} _M = S _M + R (c _A \ ln c_A + c _B \ ln c _B)
        \end{equation}\\

    \section{ Observable indicators}


    \subsection{ Segregating liquid alloys}

        From the point of view of interatomic interactions, a binary alloy is either (i) an ordered
    alloy, where unlike atoms are chosen as nearest neighbors over like atoms, or (ii) a
    segregated alloy, where like atoms are chosen to pairs as nearest neighbors over unlike
    atoms. Unfortunately, there is no direct way to distinguish the constituent atoms and
    hence the identification of a nearest-neighbor pair of atoms is challenging. In this case
    either the structural data or the experimental thermodynamic functions (such as activity, the heat of
    mixing, excess Gibbs energy of mixing, excess heat capacity, etc) or other thermophysical
    data (such as viscosity, diffusivity, density, surface tension, electrical resistivity, etc) are
    supposed to extract information associated with interatomic interactions. Some of the
    empirical criteria as well as microscopic parameters which are used to identify segregated
    alloys are summarized below.\\
    (a) Alloys displaying positive deviations from Raoult’s law.\\
    (b) The heat of formation and the excess Gibbs energy of mixing are positive.\\
    (c) The concentration fluctuation in the long-wavelength limit ($ S _{cc}(0) $) is greater than
        the ideal value.


        Table 1 provides a list of $G^{xs} _{M}$ , $H _M$ and $S^{xs} _{M}$ at the equiatomic composition 
    of segregating liquid alloys which are arranged according to the type of their phase equilibria. Of these Bi–
    Zn, Pb–Zn, Cu–Pb, Cd–Ga, Al–Bi, Al–In, Al–Pb, etc, exhibit liquid immiscibility. $G^{xs} _{M}$ and
    $ H _M $ are comparatively large positive quantities. For these alloys only a few experimental
    heat capacity data are available . The data, in general, show a decrease in Cp with increasing temperature. The energetic and structural effects in the
    solution phase can be more directly seen by the excess heat capacity $\Delta  C _p $values:

        \begin{equation}
            \Delta  C _p = C_p(c) - c_A \ C_{p,A} - c_B \ C_{p,B} 
        \end{equation}
        \\
        \\
        \\
        \\
    $\Delta  C _p $ are positive and indicate maximum values near to $ T _c$ and $c _c$ . \\

        Since the pioneering work by Hume-Rothery and his coworkers (Ref.\cite{s4} Hume-
    Rothery and Raynor 1954), a substantial effort has been assembled to identify the factors
    impacting the alloying behavior of liquid metallic mixtures, such as the difference in atomic
    sizes, valence differences, electronegativity differences, etc. For the sake of a brief perusal, 
    we enroll the basic physical, thermochemical and structural properties of pure liquid metals
    (near the melting points) in table 1.1 which are the components of the binary mixture of
    table 1. These properties are also useful for further discussions. At this step, it is not
    possible to single out any individual elemental properties which might be held reliable
    for demixing of liquid alloys. Yet, the practical analyses recommend
    that quantities such as atomic size, the heat of vaporization, and electronegativity together hold
    the key to the knowledge  of the segregation or order in a liquid alloy.


    \subsection{ Thermodynamic properties }


        Some of the thermodynamic properties of equiatomic segregating liquid alloys are tabulated
    in table 1. Here we intend to discuss briefly the salient features of the various experimental
    techniques and the specific results that exist as a function of concentration and temperature.
    The experimental methods used to obtain reliable thermodynamic data at constant pressure
    as a function of composition and temperature are briefly summarized.The entropy of formation $S _M$ 
    of an alloy can only be defined directly from $C _p$(c, T ) data 
        \begin{equation}
            S _M(c,T) = \int_{0}^{T}  \,\frac{\Delta {C _p(c,T)}}{T} dT 
        \end{equation}

    To obtain $S _M$ according to equations (28) and (29) the $C _p$ values of the components and the
    alloy have to be known down to 0 K as well as the entropy of transformations that take
    place below T . There are several problems. At first, the differences between the Cp valuesof the mechanical mixture and the alloy are small and one has to know the $ C _p$ values to 
    high accuracy to get reliable results for $S _M$ . Equation (29) uses likewise to ordered
    crystalline substances in the solid-state only. Alloys are occasionally disordered at room
    temperature and remain so down to 0 K. $S _M$ values of a liquid alloy cannot be acquired from
    equation (29) because the $C _p $  values of the undercooled liquid state for the components and
    the alloys have to be verified specifically. Since for multicomponent systems, the reference 
    state is the mechanical mixture of the pure components in the same state as the solution,
    the entropy of formation of solid and liquid alloys are, hence, typically confined from
    experimentally obtained $ G _M$(c, T) and $ H _M $(c, T) values according to equation (5).


    \subsection{ Calometric measurements}


    The enthalpy of formation $ H _M $, their partial values  $ \overline{H} _{M,i} $
    and the heat capacity of liquid alloys can be directly specified by calorimetric methods.
    An isoperibolic type of calorimeter which operates at constant T is particularly appropriate for
    calculating $H _M $ and $ \overline{H} _{M,i} $ of a liquid alloy as a function of composition 
    at constant T directly.The $ H _M $ values acquired for liquid In–Cd alloys at 628 K are
    shown in figure 2 as an example.
    \begin{adjustbox}{center,caption={Enthalpy of mixing of liquid Cd–In alloys.},label={somelabel},nofloat=figure,vspace=\bigskipamount}
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig-3.jpg}
    \end{adjustbox}

    If the modification in concentration $ \Delta c _A $ is small for each successive step (i.e. $ <  1 \ at.\% $),
    $ dH _M (c)/dc $ can be confined in a suitable approximation by


        \begin{equation}
        \frac{ dH _M (c)}{dc _A} \left(c _A + \frac{\Delta c _A}{2} \right) = \frac{H _M 
        (c _A + \Delta c _A )-H _M (c _A)}{\Delta c _A } 
        \end{equation} 

    The partial values of a multi-component system are obtained by

        \begin{equation}
            \overline{H} _{M,i} = H _M + \sum_{j = 2}^{r} (\delta _{ij} - c _j)\frac{\partial H _M{(c)}}{\partial c _j}   
        \end{equation} 

    with $ \delta  _{ij} =0 $ for $i \neq  j$ and $ \delta  _{ij} =1 $ for $i = j$ . r is the 
    number of components. Figure 3 shows the experimentally determined slope $ d H _M / dc _{C _d} $ 
    of liquid In–Cd alloys at 628 K. These results undoubtedly show that small deviations from a standard solution behaviour $ (H _M (c) = Ac _Ac _B) $
    exist.\cite{s3} \\

    The heat capacity of liquid alloys can be specified directly by adiabatic calorimetry.
    Adiabatic calorimetry applies to calculate the heat input $ \Delta Q $ to a sample and the 
    associated temperature increase $ \Delta T $.
    Heat losses have to be minimized by proper surroundings to approximate an adiabatic
    chamber for the sample. The specific heat over the temperature increase is given by 


        \begin{equation}
            C _p = \frac{\Delta Q}{m\Delta T} 
        \end{equation}   
    where m is the mass of the sample.\\

    \section{ Optimization of thermodynamic data}  

    Thermodynamic calculations of phase equilibria are widely used to check the consistency
    of data got from different experimental measurements (phase diagram data, results of
    calorimetry ). Model descriptions using statistical
    thermodynamics or polynomial expressions are used to represent the thermodynamic
    properties of all phases applied.The adjustable coefficients are determined by a weighted
    least-squares method (Ref.\cite{s6} Lukas and Fries 1992). The essential feature of this procedure
    is to obtain a uniform set of model parameters in an analytical representation. This helps
    one to gather into temperature and concentration regions where the direct experimental
    determination is difficult. It also allows one to estimate safely the thermodynamic data of
    metastable phases. Finally, the thermodynamic description of multicomponent systems can
    be gathered from those already calculated for their subsystems. The strategy of such a
    critical assessment will be demonstrated for the demixing Al–In, Al–Pb, Cd–Ga, and Bi–Zn
    systems. \\


    \subsection{ The Al–In System }

    The $ H _M $ values near the equiatomic composition received by Ref.\cite{s7} Predel and 
    Sandig (1969a) are about 50\% more enormous than the values determined by 
    Girard (1985) Ref.\cite{s8}and Sommer et al (1993) .The alloy samples, each of about 0.5 
    g, were included in a closed graphite crucible which was encapsulated under 
    argon in a quartz glass ampule. The quartz glass ampules were mechanically 
    vibrated at about 1200 K to ensure a homogeneous liquid alloy before the DTA 
    experiment on cooling was formed to obtain the binodal. The critical temperature 
    amounted to 1112 K. \\
        In the background of this information, the optimization 
    is performed. The major task is to characterize the thermodynamic properties 
    as a power-series law whose coefficients
    (say, A, B, C, D, . . .) are determined by the least-squares method. The 
    heat capacity can be expressed as

        \begin{equation}
            C _p = -C - 2DT -2ET^{-2} - ....
        \end{equation}
    The enthalpy and energy is given by\\

        \begin{equation}
            H = H(T _0) + \int_{0}^{T}  \,C _pdT
        \end{equation}
    or\\
        \  $ H = A - CT -DT^{2} + 2ET^{-1} - .... $ \\
    and
        \begin{equation}
            S = S(T_0) + \int_{0}^{T}  \,\frac{C _p}{T} dT 
        \end{equation}

    or\\
    \   $ S = -B -C(1 + lnT) - 2DT +ET^{-2} - ... $\\

    Using equation (5), the T dependence of the Gibbs energy may be written as\\

        \begin{equation}
            G = A + BT + CT ln T +DT^2 + ET^{-1} + ... 
        \end{equation}

    The composition dependency of the excess Gibbs energy of mixing 
    is given by a polynomial such as the Redlich–Kister polynomial 
    (Redlich and Kister 1948):

        \begin{equation}
            G^{xs}_M{(c, T)} = c _Ac _B\sum_{l = 0}^{m} K _l{(T)}(c_A - c _B)^l   
        \end{equation}
    with $ K_l (T ) = A _l + B_l T + C_l T ln T + D_l T^{2} + ...$ The coefficients Kl have the same
    temperature dependence as G in equation (37). The partial
    quantities are given by \\

        \begin{equation}
            \overline{G}^{xs}_A{(c, T)} = c _B^{2}\sum_{l = 0}^{m} K _l{(T)}[(1 + 2l)c_A - c _B](c_A - c _B)^{l-1}  
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            \overline{G}^{xs}_B{(c, T)} = c _A^{2}\sum_{l = 0}
            ^{m} K _l{(T)}[c_A - (1 + 2l)c _B](c_A - c _B)^{l-1}  
        \end{equation}

    The pure solid elements Al and In in their stable form at 298.15 K 
    and 1bar were chosen as the reference state of the system. 
    The Gibbs energies of the elements as functions of the \\

    temperature were compiled by Dinsdale (1991) and no solid 
    solubility was considered. The excess Gibbs energy of the 
    liquid alloy is represented by equation (37). The optimized 
    coefficients are given in table (3) and the phase diagram in 
    figure (4).\\



    \subsection{ The Al–Pb system.}

    The experimental results on Al–Pb imply a vast liquid
    miscibility gap due to the strong segregation tendency of the components. The solubility of
    lead in solid aluminum is less than 0.025 at.\% Pb at the monotectic temperature of around
    932 K. The solubility of Al in Pb is basically negligible. A lot of phase diagram data are
    available at temperatures below 1200 K in narrow terminal sides below 3 at.\% Pb and above 90 
    at.\% Pb. These data are in acceptable agreement as the evaluation of McAlister (1984) has 
    shown. McAlister has evaluated a critical temperature of 1839 K at 44.8 at.\% Pb. This $T _c$
    value is considerably higher than the value specified by Predel and Sandig (1969b) operating
    DTA. Yu et al (1996) have redetermined the binodal using a new isopiestic method (Wang et al 
    1993). There are only a few thermodynamic data available, due to the experimental
    difficulties associated with the small solubility of liquid aluminum and lead, and the high
    vapor pressure of lead at high temperatures.\\

    The phase equilibria are calculated by choosing the pure elements in their stable state at 
    298.15 K and 1 bar as the reference state of the system. Their Gibbs energies are given by 
    Dinsdale (1991). The excess Gibbs energy of the liquid alloy is represented by equation (37). 
    The calculation carried out by Yu et al (1996) takes into account the elemental thermodynamic 
    data due to Dinsdale (1991), the phase diagram data at
    temperatures above 1500 K that are obtained with the isopiestic method, and the data of Predel 
    and Sandig (1969b) on the Pb-rich side below 1600 K. The resulting optimized set of parameters 
    are given in table (4). The entire phase diagram is given in figure (6).

    \subsection{ The Cd–Ga system.}

    The Cd–Ga system shows a flat liquid miscibility gap with $T _c$ = 568 K and $c^{c}_{Ga}$ = 39.9 at.\% (see figure 12). 
    The pure solid elements in their stable state at 298.15 K and 1 bar were chosen as
    the reference state of the system and no solid solubility of the components was considered. The
    Gibbs energies of the pure elements were taken from Dinsdale (1991). The excess Gibbs
    energy of the liquid alloy was expressed with equation (37) and the resulting coefficient
    set of the optimization is given in table 4.

    The calculated phase equilibria are shown in

    The liquid zinc-rich Bi–Zn alloys exhibit a comprehensive miscibility
    gap with $T _c$ = 863.8 K,  $c^{c}_{Zn}$  = 87 at.\% (see figure 10). At the monotectic temperature
    of 688.5 K hcp zinc and two liquid alloys with the composition 38.6 and 99.1 at.\% Zn, 
    respectively, are in equilibrium. These results are obtained from an optimization calculation
    by the least-squares method (Lukas et al 1977). Preliminary results are given by Wang et al
    (1993). No solid solubility of the components was assumed. The thermodynamic data for the
    elements were assumed from Dinsdale (1991). The resulting set of coefficients describing $G^{xs}_M$
    (equation (37)) of the liquid alloys is given in table 5.

    \section{ Electronic theory of mixing }

        The electronic theory in a major way provides a platform where the energies and structure of
    a liquid metallic system can be merged (Harrison 1966, Heine 1970, Stroud and Ashcroft
    1972) to remove absorbing physical properties of the system. 
    There is no exact difference between nearly-free-electron (NFE) and non-NFE alloys. Yet, the 
    physical properties of the two classes of alloys that are dependent on the number of valence 
    electrons (electrical resistivity, thermoelectric power, Hall coefficient, magnetic 
    susceptibility, knight shift) are usually extremely distinguishable. Also, the valence and 
    the electronegativity differences are smaller in NFE and larger for the non-NFE systems.
    The work on phase-separating liquid alloys based on electronic theory is insufficient,
    although safe to apply to simple segregating liquid alloys without incurring noticeable error. 
    The value of the theory stands from the fact that it is free from any assumptions
    and, as such, there should not be an adaptable parameter. One can, at least, gather some
    first-hand information on the basic interatomic forces ($\varphi  _{ij}$ ) which are directly related to the
    energy parameter ($\omega $) occurring in previous sections. In addition, it helps to identify 
    the volume and the structure-dependent contributions to the energy of the process of mixing.\\

    \subsection{ Pseudopotential perturbation scheme}

    The NFE binary alloys can be considered to consist of a system of ions and valence electrons.
    The fundamental Hamiltonian which explains the system is of the form\\

        \begin{equation}
            H = H_e + H_i + H_{ei}
        \end{equation}
    with
        \begin{equation}
            H_e = T _{elec} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i = j}^{} \frac{e^2}{|\overline{r_i} - \overline{r_j}|} - H^{\prime }  
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            H_i = T_{ions} +\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i = j}^{} \frac{z_{i}z_{j}e^2}{|{R_i} - {R_j}|} - H^{\prime }  
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            H_{ei} = \sum_{i , j}^{} {V(\overline{r_i} - \overline{R_j})} + 2H^{\prime }  
        \end{equation}

    (e, electron; i, ion; and ei, electron-ion). T stands for kinetic energy,$\overline{r}$and $\overline{}$are 
    electronic and atomic positions and z is the valency. It is assumed that electrons and ions 
    always interact among themselves Coulombically. The electron-ion interaction V will be accepted 
    as a pseudopotential. Within an acceptable uncertainty, the ions are likely to drive much more 
    slowly than the electrons, and, hence, the various contributions thus deriving from (40) can 
    be treated individually. $H^{\prime}$  is the self-energy of a uniform charge distribution that is 
    inserted to maintain the net potential energy expressions finitely. Referring to Hamiltonian 
    (40), the internal energy, E, can be described in atomic units (for a detailed description
    see Ashcroft and Stroud (1978)),

        \begin{equation}
        E = E_e + E_i + (E^{I} _{ei} + E^{II} _{ei})
        \end{equation}
    with

    \begin{align}

        \end{align}\\

    where $K_F = \left( 3\pi ^{2}\overline{z}\varrho\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ , $\overline{z}\varrho = z_{A}\varrho_{A} + z_{B}\varrho_{B}$ and $\overline{z} = c_{A}z_{A} + c_{B}z_{B}$
    ; $z_A$ and $z_B$ are valencies, $\varrho _A$ and $\varrho _B$ are the number densities of the ion 
    species and $\varrho = \varrho _A + \varrho _B $ . $E^{I}_{ei}$ and $E^{II}_{ei}$ are due to
    the electron-ion interaction specified through first and second-order pseudopotential 
    perturbation
    theory, respectively. $V(q)$ is the Fourier transform of the bare ion pseudopotential and is
    named the form factor. $\epsilon ^{\ast}(q)$ is the altered Hartree dielectric function which brings into 
    account the interaction of the conduction electrons.\\

        $S_{ij}$ are the partial structure factors that take care of the arrangement of ions in the
    system. For a hard-sphere system,  $S_{ij}$ can readily be calculated following the work by
    Ashcroft and Langreth (1967). The necessary inputs are the diameters of the hard spheres ($\sigma $)
    whose preference has always been a matter of interest (see, for example, Faber 1972, Shimoji
    1977). However, to make the present scheme internally consistent, we suggest that $\sigma$ should be 
    specified in the variational thermodynamic purpose equipping minimum free
    energy for the system, i.e.
        \begin{equation}
        \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \sigma }\right) _{\Omega ,T} = 0
        \end{equation}
    with\\
        \begin{equation}
            F = E - TS_{hs}
        \end{equation}
    where $S_{hs}$ is the entropy of the hard sphere mixture which consists of \\
        \begin{equation}
            S_{hs} = S_{id} + S_{gas} + S_{\eta} + S_{\sigma}
        \end{equation}
    where $S_{id}$ is the ideal entropy of mixing, $S_{gas}$ is the ideal gas entropy, $S_{\eta}$ 
    is the contribution
    which depends only on packing density and $S_{\sigma}$ denotes the entropy contribution due to
    mismatch of the hard sphere diameters $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ .\\
        The operating expressions for these quantities may be described as (Mansoori et al 1971,
    Umar et al 1974): 
    

    \begin{align}
        &  S_{id} = -k_B \sum_{i = 1}^{2} c_{i} lnc_{i} \\
        &  S_{gas} = \frac{5}{2}k_{B} + k_{B}ln\left[\frac{1}{\varrho}\left(\frac{m^{c_{A}}_{A}m^{c_{B}}_{B}k_{B}T}{{2\pi \hbar ^{2}}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} \right] \\
        &  S_{\eta} = k_B lnb + 1.5k_{B}(1 - b^2)\\
        & S_{\sigma} = \frac{\pi c_{A}c_{B}\varrho(\sigma_{A} - \sigma_{B})^{2}b^{2}}{24}[12(\sigma_{A} + \sigma_{B}) -
        \pi \varrho (c_{A}\sigma^{4}_{A} + c_{B}\sigma^{4}_{B})]     
        \end{align}\\

    with $b = (1 - \eta)^{-1}$ . The first two terms in equation (51) are structure-independent terms and 
    depend only on concentration c, atomic mass m, and atomic volume $\Omega $. The last two terms are 
    structure-dependent contributions due to the existence of the packing
    fraction, $\eta (= (\pi \varrho/6)(c_A\sigma^3_A + c_B\sigma^3_{B})) $ and the hard-sphere diameter $\sigma _{i}$ .\\
        The present method helps to specify the energy contributions from the constituent
    species such as electrons and ions. Also, it helps us to separate the energies of the formation
    of a binary alloy due to just volume-dependent and structure-dependent contributions,
    respectively.\\
    The Hamiltonian as expressed in equation (40) allows (see, for example, Ashcroft and Stroud 1978, Young
    1992) one to estimate the effective interatomic potentials as,
        \begin{equation}
            \phi _{ij}(r) = \frac{z_{i}z_{j}e^2}{r} + \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3}\int_{}^{}  \,\frac{q^2}{4\pi e^2}V_{i}(q)V_{j}(q)
            \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon ^{\ast}(q) } - 1\right]\frac{\sin qr}{qr} 4\pi q^2 dq 
        \end{equation}
    $\phi _{ij}(r)$ can readily be coupled to the radial distribution function, $g_{ij}(r)$.\\

    \section{ Hard-sphere like theory for segregation}

    \subsection{ Hard sphere mixture under the Percus–Yevick approximation}

    The stability of binary alloys by treating them as a mixture of hard spheres, i.e.

    \begin{align}
        \phi (r)& = \infty \tag{for $r<0$} \\
        \phi (r)& = 0  \tag{for $r>0$} \\
    \end{align}


    Although the potential (equation (57)) is devoid of an attractive interaction, it equips a 
    useful insight into which forms the effective short-range repulsive interaction governs the 
    geometrical packing at metallic densities. The quantity of major significance is the direct
    correlation function, $C_{ij}(r)$ , which is connected to $g_{ij}(r)$ and $\phi_{ij}(r)$ via the Percus–Yevick
    (PY) equation (Percus and Yevick 1958):
        \begin{equation}
            C_{ij}(r) = g_{ij}(r)\left(1 - exp\frac{\phi_{ij}}{k_{B}T}\right)          \tag*{(i , j = A , B)}
        \end{equation}
    The analytical solution of the PY equation for a mixture of hard spheres was obtained by 
    Lebowitz (see Lebowitz 1964, Lebowitz and Rowlinson 1964). As regards the hard-core 
    interactions in the mixture, these authors considered additive hard-sphere mixtures, i.e
        \begin{equation}
            \sigma_{AB} = \frac{\sigma_{AA} + \sigma_{BB} }{2}
        \end{equation}
    The free energy per particle of the mixture can be written as
    \begin{align}
        &  F_{hs} = c_{A}\mu_{A} + c_{B}\mu_{B} - P _{hs}\Omega \\
        &  G_{hs} = c_{A}\mu_{A} + c_{B}\mu_{B}
        \end{align}
    Here the $\mu_i$ are the chemical potentials of the components and $P _{hs}$ is the pressure:

        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\mu_i}{k_{B}T} = ln \left[\Omega ^{-1}_{i}\left(\frac{2\pi \overline{h}^2}
            {m_{i}k_{B}T}\right)^(3/2)\right] - ln (1 - \eta) + \frac{3X\sigma_{ij}}{(1 - 
            \eta)} + \frac{3}{2}\left[\frac{3X^2}{(1 - \eta )^2} + \frac{2Y}{(1 - \eta)}\right] 
            \sigma^2_{ii} + \frac{\pi P _{hs}\sigma^3_{ii}}{6k_{B}T}
        \end{equation}
    and

        \begin{equation}
            \frac{P _{hs}}{k_{B}T} = \frac{\Omega ^{-1}(1 + \eta + \eta^2) - \frac{1}{2}\pi 
            \Omega ^{-1}_{A}\Omega ^{-1}_{B}(\sigma_{AA} - \sigma_{BB})^{2}
            (\sigma_{AA} + \sigma_{BB} + \sigma_{AA}\sigma_{BB}X)}{(1 - \eta)^3}
        \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{align}
        &  X = \frac{\pi}{6\Omega } \sum_{i}^{}c_{i}\sigma^{2}_{ii}  \\
        &  Y = \frac{\pi}{6\Omega } \sum_{i}^{}c_{i}\sigma_{ii} \\
        &  \eta = \frac{\pi}{6\Omega } \sum_{i}^{}c_{i}\sigma^{3}_{ii} 
        \end{align}
    $m_i$ indicate the masses of the spheres. The entropy ($S = -\left(\partial F/\partial T\right)_\Omega $) 
    of the hard sphere
    mixture, as in equation (51), can readily be derived from equation (59). Equation (60)
    can be used to obtain an expression for the concentration fluctuations, $S_{cc}(0)$, for binary
    hard sphere mixtures, i.e.
    \begin{equation}
        S_{cc}(0) = RT \left(\frac{\partial^{2}G_{hs}}{\partial c^2}\right) ^{-1}_{T,p}
    \end{equation}

    Substitution of equations (60)-(65) in (66) gives (see Osman and Singh 1993, 1995):
    \begin{equation}
    {S^{hs}_{cc}(0)}^{-1} = \frac{1}{c_{A}c_{B}} + \frac{\pi}{2\Omega }\left[\frac{9X^{3}d^{2}_{3}}{(1 - \eta)^4} +
            \frac{18X^{2}d_{2}d_{3}  +  4XYd^{2}_{3}} 
            {(1 - \eta)^3} + \frac{9Xd^{2}_{2} + 4Yd_{1}d_{2} + 4Xd_{1}d_{3} + (\pi / 18\Omega)d^{2}_{3}}
            {(1 - \eta)^2} + \frac{4d_{1}d_{2}}{(1 - \eta)}\right] 
        \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{equation}
    d_1 = \sigma _{AA} - \sigma _{BB}  ,   
    d_2 = \sigma ^{2}_{AA} - \sigma ^{2}_{BB}  ,  
    d_3 = \sigma ^{3}_{AA} - \sigma ^{3}_{BB}   
    \end{equation} 
    It is evident from equation (67) that if
        \begin{equation}
            \sigma _{AA} = \sigma _{BB} = \sigma _{AB}
        \end{equation}
    then 
    \begin{equation}
        S^{hs}_{cc}(0) =  c_{A}c_{A}
    \end{equation}
    Equation (69) is the required condition that a mixture of hard spheres is an
    ideal mixture.\\

    The values of $S^{\ast }_{cc}(0)$$[= S^{hs }_{cc}(0)/c_{A}c_{B}]$ acquired from equation (67)
    for different values
    of size ratio, $ \gamma (= \sigma_{BB}/\sigma_{AA} , \sigma_{BB}> \sigma_{AA})$ is shown in 
    figure 13. The curve for $\gamma = 1$,
    corresponds to the ideal mixture. With the expansion of size ratio, the values of $S^{\ast}_{cc}(0)$ decrease
    rapidly from the ideal value indicating an ordered state. The larger the values of $\gamma$ , the
    more ordered a state is achieved in the mixture for $\gamma > 2.0$; a flat minimum is observed
    over a wide range of concentrations.\\
    The results of figure 13 display that $S^{\ast}_{cc}(0)$ cannot be greater than 1 for any size effect. Hence a binary hard-sphere mixture within the working conditions of equations (57)
    and (58) is consistently stable, i.e. there is no segregation for any mismatch size ratio. This is
    a notable result since the work by Lebowitz and Rowlinson (1964), who indicated that
    the excess Gibbs energy for a binary mixture is consistently negative for all size effects and so
    phase separation does not arise.

    \subsection{ Hard spheres beyond the Percus–Yevick approximation}

    Biben and Hansen (1991) evaluated the numerical solution of the integral equations associating
    the total ($h_{ij}$) and the direct ($C_{ij}$) correlation functions. In the Percus–Yevick approximation,
    one maintains
        \begin{equation}
        g^{PY}_{ij}(r) = \theta (r - \sigma_{ij})(1 + \gamma_{ij}(r))
        \end{equation}
    where
        \begin{equation}
            \gamma_{ij}(r) = h_{ij}(r) - C_{ij}(r)
        \end{equation}
    $\theta(x)$ represents the step function. These authors utilized a parametrized form of equation (71)
    (for example, Baltone et al (BPGG) (1986), Rogers and Young (RY) (1984)),
    \begin{align}
        &  g^{BPGG}_{ij}(r) = \theta (r - \sigma_{ij}) exp[(1 + s\gamma_{ij}(r))^{1/s} - 1 ] \\
        &  g^{RY}_{ij}(r) = \theta (r - \sigma_{ij}) \left[1 + 
        \frac{exp(\gamma_{ij}(r)f_{ij}(r)) - 1}{f_{ij}(r)} \right]
            \end{align}
    The parameters s and $f_{ij}(r)$ are modified to fulfill a thermodynamic consistency via
    the equation of state. The numerical solutions of equations (71)-(74) were obtained for
    different size ratios $y(= \sigma_A/\sigma_B)$ , here $\sigma_A > \sigma_B$ = 0.5, 0.2, 0.15 and 0.1.\\

        The results obtained for $\Lambda = c_{A}c_{B}{S_{cc}(0)}^{-1}$ are shown in figure 14 as a function of the
    packing fraction $\eta_{2} $($\eta_{2} = \pi \sigma^{3}_{B}/6\Omega _{B}$ , is the partial 
    packing fraction of the bigger component
    B). The results display that the mixture with the size ratio y = 0.5 conducts nearly ideally
    and the predictions of the PY, RY and BPGG equations are close for all $\eta_2$. These equations,
    ultimately, were discovered to differ extensively for larger y. $\Lambda (= c_{A}c_{B}{S_{cc}(0)}^{-1})$  received with
    the PY closure continuously increases with $\eta_2$ , whereas RY and PBGG closures indicate an opposite
    movement. With enriching $\eta_2$ ,$\Lambda $ falls rapidly, i.e. the concentration fluctuations 
    become very strong. On its distinction, these authors finalize that phase separation occurs for size 
    ratios $y \geq 2$ .
    \begin{adjustbox}{center,caption={Concentration fluctuations $\Lambda = c_{A}c_{B}{S_{cc}(0)}^{-1}$ 
        against packing fraction $\eta_2$.Full curves,unsteady curves and circles are for the RY, 
        PY and BPGG results, respectively. 
        Curves labelled from 1 to 4 are for size ratio y = 0.5, 0.2, 0.15 and 0.1 (y = 
        $\sigma_{A}/\sigma_{B}$, $\sigma_{A} > \sigma_{B}$ after Biben and
        Hansen (1991)).},

        Quite descending in line, Lekkerkerker and Stroobants (1993) analyzed the osmotic pressure
    of a mixture of hard-sphere colloids with strongly asymmetric sizes. The osmotic equation
    of state expresses a spinodal instability. The origin of the instability is interpreted to be the
    attractive depletion interaction between the large spheres, which is caused by the presence
    of the smaller spheres.\\
        Furthermore, Frenkel and Louis (1992) in an attempt to map hard-core mixtures onto
    lattice models with nearest-neighbor attraction, verified that the entropy associated
    with hard-core repulsion may pose as an effective attraction that causes the demixing process.
    Dijkstra and Frenkel (1994) performed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation studies of
    a mixture consisting of large and small cubes where the independent variables were the
    fugacities of the cubes. Such a method also generates a demixing transition in a binary
    hard-core mixture.\\


    \section{Summary}

    Deviations in the equilibrium surface composition of ordered alloys with temperature depend on 
    interatomic energetic parameters, the surface orientation, and its primary, low-temperature 
    termination. In case the segregation process is endothermic and the low-temperature termination 
    corresponds to entropy-driven segregation that
    grows with temperature is expected. The segregation properties of liquid binary alloys are 
    systematically investigated via two different thermodynamic quantities, namely, the energy of mixing 
    $\Delta F$ and
    the entropy of mixing $\Delta S$. Both $\Delta F$ and $\Delta S$ agree with the interrelated 
    experimental data in the mixed state.We are now in a situation to draw the following summary of 
    this project (i) The GMT together with the perturbation approach can explain, at least qualitatively, 
    the energy of mixing and the thermodynamic state-dependent partial miscibility of liquid binary alloys.
    (ii) Below the critical temperature, this alloy starts getting partially miscible. 
    The critical concentration matches precisely with the experimental value of Predel .
    (iii) Finding positiveness of the energy of
    mixing would have been impossible if the volume dependent
    term, $\Delta F$ vol was not there as a prevalent positive quantity.
